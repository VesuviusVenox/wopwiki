                    <div class="content-box news-text">
                        The Balloony is the World of Padman counterpart of the Grenade Launcher in Quake 3 Arena. It works similarly to its Quake 3 Arena counterpart, with the same fuse time, but having lower damage in trade off for larger splash radius, and projectiles launched by Balloony bounce more erratically than the Quake 3 Arena counterpart.

                <article class="outer-box news-item">
                    <div class="inner-box news-body">
                       <div class="header-box news-head">

                       <div class="content-box news-text">
                        •Because of how long it takes for Balloony's water bombs to explode, the Balloony should generally not be used as a weapon to fight an opponent with. Use it to cover your tracks when you're retreating, to pepper the entrances to an area, and to launch a surprise attack on two people fighting. Otherwise, don't use it. If you have to fight somebody, take out your Bubble G or Boaster instead.
                       </div>
                       <div class="content-box news-text">
                        •If you want to fight an enemy with the Balloony, remember that you need to make direct impacts with its water bombs. Otherwise, the bombs will harmlessly bounce away from where you were previously firing them, especially if you are trying to run backwards or planning to retreat somehow; try to bounce them off the surfaces like rear walls and the ground. If you can, try to lure your target into a small room so that he'll be affected by the splash damage from the water bombs that didn't hit him. Doing so will make it easier for you to kill him with one direct impact. Bouncing Balloons off from walls or the ground will generally surprise the opponent and a well made spray with another weapon like the Bubble G or the Boaster will fend them off to the Balloony blasts.
                       </div>
                       <div class="content-box news-text">
                        •If you see somebody with it, it usually means they're trying to run away. If they don't notice you, shoot them a few times, because they're probably pretty weak as-is. If they do, run away, because they'll try to hit you with a few water bombs as well. Because the Ballonny makes more noise than Betty, the Balloony may not be viable if you are being chased and you are in a corridor-like area.
                       </div>
                       <div class="content-box news-text">
                        •The Balloony is useful for killing unaware players or block the pickups that they're about to take. Also, the Balloony is good for area-denial, covering the important items and objectives. If you see two or more players fighting in the distance, fire a few water bombs at them. Usually, at least one of the bombs will kill one of them. Doing this might anger some players, but some would consider such outbursts part of the fun of spamming the Balloony's shots.
